Final Integrated Project

This is it! This is my final project of semester one.

I've learned that I really need to put aside time to learn GitHub and CSS because I have little to no idea, as to what to do here.

Anyways,

PLANT LIFE is the name of the WebSite. It's about my indoor Cacti and Succulents. You can purchase them, or just look at them because they look like something you'd find on an alien planet.

The second page is PLANT CARE. It has information on how to care for indoor desert plants such as the cacti and succulents.

The final page of the website is a CONTACT page. You can contact me about any plants that look appealing and you can buy them from me. No, really, please buy them. I have no room for any more.. and I'm a broke student.


Please bless me with a second semester.
